Sometimes the most valuable learning comes from seeing how someone else learned. This section contains the raw, unpolished notes that formed the foundation of this documentation—handwritten observations, trial-and-error discoveries, and the actual learning process. These materials offer a different perspective than polished documentation, showing the questions and confusion that naturally arise when learning Git, and how to work through them.
